/**
 * Annotation for mapping web requests onto methods in request-handling classes
 * with flexible method signatures.
 *
 * <p>Both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux support this annotation through a
 * {@code RequestMappingHandlerMapping} and {@code RequestMappingHandlerAdapter}
 * in their respective modules and package structure. For the exact list of
 * supported handler method arguments and return types in each, please use the
 * reference documentation links below:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Spring MVC
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-arguments">Method Arguments</a>
 * and
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-return-types">Return Values</a>
 * </li>
 * <li>Spring WebFlux
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-ann-arguments">Method Arguments</a>
 * and
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-ann-return-types">Return Values</a>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This annotation can be used both at the class and
 * at the method level. In most cases, at the method level applications will
 * prefer to use one of the HTTP method specific variants
 * {@link GetMapping @GetMapping}, {@link PostMapping @PostMapping},
 * {@link PutMapping @PutMapping}, {@link DeleteMapping @DeleteMapping}, or
 * {@link PatchMapping @PatchMapping}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> When using controller interfaces (e.g. for AOP proxying),
 * make sure to consistently put <i>all</i> your mapping annotations - such as
 * {@code @RequestMapping} and {@code @SessionAttributes} - on
 * the controller <i>interface</i> rather than on the implementation class.
